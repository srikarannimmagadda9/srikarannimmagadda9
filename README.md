# Welcome!

Hey, I'm Srikaran Nimmagadda, a tech enthusiast and college student at the intersection of innovation and learning. I'm immersing myself in the craft of coding, starting from the ground up with CS50x, while Git anchors my collaborative projects. My toolkit grows as I finesse front-end design using HTML, CSS, and the versatile React, with TypeScript ensuring my code remains clean and maintainable. Embracing the transformative power of blockchain, I delve into Solidity for a glimpse into future tech landscapes. Complementing my technical endeavors, I'm also soaking in entrepreneurial knowledge from MIT OpenCourseWare and Y Combinator's resources, all while navigating the challenges and rewards of college life.
